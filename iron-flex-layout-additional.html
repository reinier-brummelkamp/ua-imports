The `<iron-flex-layout>` component provides simple ways to use
[CSS flexible box layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Flexible_boxes),
also known as flexbox. This component provides two different ways to use flexbox:

1. [Layout classes](https://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-flex-layout/tree/master/iron-flex-layout-classes.html).
The layout class stylesheet provides a simple set of class-based flexbox rules, that
let you specify layout properties directly in markup. You must include this file
in every element that needs to use them.

  Sample use:

      <link rel="import" href="../iron-flex-layout/iron-flex-layout-classes.html">
      <style is="custom-style" include="iron-flex iron-flex-alignment"></style>

      <div class="layout horizontal layout-start">
        <div>cross axis start alignment</div>
      </div>

2. [Custom CSS mixins](https://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-flex-layout/blob/master/iron-flex-layout.html).
The mixin stylesheet includes custom CSS mixins that can be applied inside a CSS rule using the `@apply` function.

Please note that the old [/deep/ layout classes](https://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-flex-layout/tree/master/classes)
are deprecated, and should not be used. To continue using layout properties
directly in markup, please switch to using the new `dom-module`-based
[layout classes](https://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-flex-layout/tree/master/iron-flex-layout-classes.html).
Please note that the new version does not use `/deep/`, and therefore requires you
to import the `dom-modules` in every element that needs to use them.

A complete [guide](https://elements.polymer-project.org/guides/flex-layout) to `<iron-flex-layout>` is available.
